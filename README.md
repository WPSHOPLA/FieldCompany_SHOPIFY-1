# FieldCompany_SHOPIFY_PreSales_PAGE

My client: Chris were looking for help tweaking the Shopify Launch Theme into a single-page store.
They were going to be using pre-sales and Celery as a plug-in.

They were trying to get a one page pre-sales page up ASAP on Shopify.
They like the idea of tweaking the Launch Theme and modeling after:

They're coming off of a successful Kickstarter and They have a friend based in Berlin who's helping with design.
He is Borahm Cho.
His design was good and I implemented with full responsive, unbounce signup, facebook, ga pixel,also.
This project takes only 2 days and was full of excitement and friendship.

I like them.
Thanks Chris and Bo.
